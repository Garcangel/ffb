/**
 * A player with this skill is a hardened veteran. Such players are called
 * professionals or Pros by other Blood Bowl players because they rarely make a
 * mistake. Once per turn, a Pro is allowed to re-roll any one dice roll he has
 * made other than Armour, Injury or Casualty, even if he is Prone or Stunned.
 * However, before the re-roll may be made, his coach must roll a D6. On a roll
 * of 4, 5 or 6 the re-roll may be made. On a roll of 1, 2 or 3 the original
 * result stands and may not be re-rolled with a skill or team re-roll; however
 * you can re-roll the Pro roll with a Team re-roll.
