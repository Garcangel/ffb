/**
 * The player is an expert at kicking the ball and can place the kick with great
 * precision. In order to use this skill the player must be set up on the pitch
 * when his team kicks off. The player may not be set up in either wide zone or
 * on the line of scrimmage. Only if all these conditions are met is the player
 * then allowed to take the kick-off. Because his kick is so accurate, you may
 * choose to halve the number of squares that the ball scatters on kick-off,
 * rounding any fractions down (i.e., 1 = 0, 2-3 = 1, 4-5 = 2, 6 = 3).
