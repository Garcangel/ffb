/**
 * At the start of a Block Action a player who is adjacent to at least two
 * opponents may choose to throw blocks against two of them. Make each block in
 * turn as normal except that each defender's strength is increased by 2. The
 * player cannot follow up either block when using this skill, so Multiple Block
 * can be used instead of Frenzy, but both skills cannot be used together. To
 * have the option to throw the second block the player must still be on his
 * feet after the first block.
