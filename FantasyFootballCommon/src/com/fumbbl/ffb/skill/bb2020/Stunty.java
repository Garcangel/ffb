/**
 * The player is so small that they are very difficult to tackle because they
 * can duck underneath opposing players' outstretched arms and run between their
 * legs. On the other hand, Stunty players are just a bit too small to throw the
 * ball very well, and are easily injured. To represent these things a player
 * with the Stunty skill may ignore any enemy tackle zones on the square he is
 * moving to when he makes a Dodge roll (i.e., they always end up with a +1
 * Dodge roll modifier), but must subtract 1 from the roll when they pass. In
 * addition, this player treats a roll of 7 and 9 on the Injurytable after any
 * modifiers have been applied as a KO'd and Badly Hurt result respectively
 * rather than the normal results. Stunties that are armed with a Secret Weapon
 * are not allowed to ignore enemy tackle zones, but still suffer the other
 * penalties.
