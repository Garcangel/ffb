/**
 * Some players are armed with special pieces of equipment that are called
 * "secret weapons". Although the Blood Bowl rules specifically ban the use of
 * any weapons, the game has a long history of teams trying to get weapons of
 * some sort onto the pitch. Nonetheless, the use of secret weapons is simply
 * not legal, and referees have a nasty habit of sending off players that use
 * them. Once a drive ends that this player has played in at any point, the
 * referee orders the player to be sent off to the dungeon to join players that
 * have been caught committing fouls during the match regardless of whether the
 * player is still on the pitch or not.
