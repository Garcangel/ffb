  add toJsonValue() and initFromJsonValue() to all steps
  (no problem shown currently because it is implemented in the superclass)

old stuff:

Christer uses mySql 5.0.60-r1

I found an instance of an invalid XML from the FFB server that's causing a result to not be pushed through.
<inducement type="starPlayer" value=""Big" Pudwick" />
The quotes in the name of the player are not properly converted into XML entities, which breaks the parsing on the FUMBBL side.

Birthday Zombies:

start date: Jan 3rd and a few on jan 4th

Fixing old replays:

Ich:  i'm asking you for a roster for a team id
 Christer:  Right, you'd have to change that to requesting for the roster id again
so, the process would be:
1. FFB requests the team
2. FUMBBL generates the team XML
3. FUMBBL generates the roster XML at the same time
4. FUMBBL does the hash, and if the hash doesn't exist in the history table, it stores the XML
5. FFB receives the team XML with the hash as a roster id
 Ich:  ok. i see. i need to change the persisted roster id for the old replays though. to include the zombies. no?
 Christer:  6. FFB requests the roster with the hash
 
i can add a column to save the roster id with each position
if empty it refers to the team roster id
 Christer:  yeah, that'd work
 Ich:  we need to fix special players then, also
as i no longer ask for roster with team id then
 Christer:  I can provide the roster they're defined in.

- handle "Get the Ref" Bribes
- test "Raise the Dead" and "Nurgle's Rot" in replays

- 30 pixel less vertical screen size (taskbar), or more -> see Whatball about background
- add new option pilingOnBanOnDouble
- Pro-Reroll for movement of ball&chain?

- problem: get rid of game.getDefenderAction() ?
- problem: pass block on dumpOff -> need game.getAttacker() to let ActingPlayer remain standing?
