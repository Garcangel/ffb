Behaviour Changes:

- Chainsaw is optional on blocks and fouls
- Catch skill grants no reroll for deflection
- Simultaneous MultiBlock (still has some issues with reflecting selection in sidebars, needs to wait until later)

Technical Changes:


Areas of Testing:

- Chainsaw
- Deflect
- MultiBlock
    + Different combinations of block, stab and chainsaw
    + Different combinations of block dice: -2/3db, 1db, 2/3db
    + 0, 1 or 2 Cas/KO in combination with 0/1/2+ Apos and Igors
    + Double attacker injury

Bugfixes:

- Bug 105: Failed dodge on a blitz causes opponent players to be unblockable if block is clocked before reroll dialog appears
- During setup avoid updating PlayerState if coordinate collision appears
